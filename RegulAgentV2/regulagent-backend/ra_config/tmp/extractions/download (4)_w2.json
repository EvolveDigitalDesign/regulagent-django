  "remarks": "The base of usable-quality water that must be protected is estimated to occur at a depth of 1650 feet below the land surface. The interval from the land surface to a depth of 300 feet and the fresh water contained in the zone from a depth of 1200 feet to 1650 feet must be isolated from water in overlying and underlying beds. This recommendation is applicable for all wells drilled in this T&P RR CO; Abstract-729; Block-40; Township-2N, Section-20. This recommendation is intended to apply to all wells drilled within 200 feet of the subject well. This recommendation is for normal drilling, production, and plugging operations only.",
