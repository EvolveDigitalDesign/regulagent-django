  "instructions_section": "Operators and cementing companies must comply with the requirements of the Commission's Statewide rules 8 (Water Protection), 13 (Casing, Cementing, Drilling, and Completion), and 14 (Well Plugging). For offshore operations, see the requirements of Rule 13 (c). An operator should file an original and one copy of the completed Form W-15 for each cementing company used on a well. The cementing of different casing strings on a well by one cementing company may be reported on one form. Form W-15 should be filed with the following: An initial oil or gas completion report, Form W-2 or G-1, as required by Statewide or special field rules; Form W-4, Application for Multiple Completion, if the well is a multiple parallel casing completion; and Form W-3, Plugging Record, unless the W-3 is signed by the cementing company representative. When reporting dry holes, operators must complete W-15, in addition to Form W-3, to show any casing cemented in the hole. The appropriate Commission District Office for the county in which the well is located. Surface casing must be set and cemented to protect all usable-quality water strata, as defined by the Texas Department of Water Resources, Austin. Centralizers must be placed every fourth joint from the cement shoe to the ground surface or to the bottom of the cellar and must meet API specifications. Exceptions and alternative casing programs require District Director approval. Intermediate and production casing must comply with Statewide Rule 12 (b) (3) and (4). Cement plugs must be placed in the wellbore as required by Statewide Rule 14. For onshore or inland wells, a 10-foot cement plug must be placed in the top of the well, and the casing must be cut off three feet below the ground surface. All cement plugs, except the top plug, must have sufficient slurry volume to fill 100 feet of hole, plus ten percent for each 1000 feet of depth from the ground surface to the bottom of the plug. Operators must use only cementers approved by the Director of Field Operations."
