  "recommendation": "The base of usable-quality water that must be protected is estimated to occur at a depth of 1650 feet below the land surface. Moreover, the interval from the land surface to a depth of 300 feet and the fresh water contained in the zone from a depth of 1200 feet to 1650 feet must be isolated from water in overlying and underlying beds. This recommendation is applicable for all wells drilled in this T&P RR CO; Abstract-729; Block-40; Township-2N, Section-20. Note: Unless stated otherwise, this recommendation is intended to apply to all wells drilled within 200 feet of the subject well. Unless stated otherwise, this recommendation is for normal drilling, production, and plugging operations only.",
